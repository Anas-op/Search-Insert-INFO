# Search-Insert-INFO

Welcome, 

This is a little i've been working for. It's used by my coworkers to search through a .txt file info about our customers ( es. Where their applications are installed). It also allow you to write info inside the same .txt, in case some information are missing. 

It's developed in Java.swing using the Netbeans IDE, you'll find the two jar files inside dist, that can be easily executable using a command line. 

More projects are coming soon...

Thank you!

Anas
