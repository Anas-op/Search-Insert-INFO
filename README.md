# Search-Insert-INFO

Welcome, 

This is a little i've been working for. It's used by my coworkers to search through a .txt file info about our customers ( es. Where their applications are installed). It also allow you to write info inside the same .txt, in case some information are missing. 

It's developed in Java.swing using the Netbeans IDE, you'll find the two jar files inside dist, that can be easily executable using a command line. 
I used the Java jdk 15. 

The program will only work if the file .txt is in the same direcory. So you can create a shortcut in your desktop that executes the jar file, positioned inside a directory with the txt file. That because in my code i used the same path of the src. 


More projects are coming soon...

Thank you!
